 *
 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The PaymentProcess class is responsible for processing reservations that
 * are pending payment. It determines whether a reservation is confirmed or canceled
 * based on a probability, and updates the respective reservation lists.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
