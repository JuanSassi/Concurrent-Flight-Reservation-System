 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The SeatStatus enum represents the different states a seat can have in the system:
 * - AVAILABLE: The seat is available for reservation.
 * - OCCUPIED: The seat has been reserved.
 * - UNAVAILABLE: The seat is unavailable for reservation.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
