 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The PendingPaymentReservations class handles the reservations that are pending payment.
 * It provides methods for adding reservations to the pending list and removing them
 * once payment processing is initiated.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
