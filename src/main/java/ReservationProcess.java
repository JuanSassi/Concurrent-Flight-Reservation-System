 *
 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The ReservationProcess class is responsible for handling the reservation
 * of seats in the flight reservation system. It interacts with the seat map
 * and manages the transfer of reserved seats to the pending payment list.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
