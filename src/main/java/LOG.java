 * @brief   LOG class responsible for logging flight reservation system information
 * @author  Juan Ignacio Sassi
 * @date    30/11/2024
 *
 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The LOG class is responsible for writing log information to a file during
 * the simulation of the reservation system. It logs the current system time,
 * the number of verified and canceled reservations, and the seat map.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
