 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The VerifiedReservations class is responsible for storing reservations
 * that have been verified. It allows adding verified reservations,
 * retrieving the list of verified reservations, and getting the size of the list.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
