 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The Seat class represents an individual seat in the reservation system,
 * managing its status (available, occupied, unavailable) and other details
 * like the seat ID and whether it has been checked.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
