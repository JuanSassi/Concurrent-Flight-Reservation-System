 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The VerificationProcess class processes reservations that have been confirmed
 * and verifies them before moving them to the VerifiedReservations list.
 * The process continues running until the global flag is false or the thread is interrupted.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
