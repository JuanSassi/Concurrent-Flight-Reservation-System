 * @details This project simulates a concurrent flight reservation system
 * developed in Java. Concurrency is achieved through thread management,
 * simulating a realistic flight reservation environment.
 * The SeatMap class represents the grid of seats in the reservation system,
 * allowing for seat reservations, random seat selection, and displaying the seat map.
 * This file is part of a project developed for the Concurrent Programming course
 * of the FCEFYN at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC).
